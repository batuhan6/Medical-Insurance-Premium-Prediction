# Medical-Insurance-Premium-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to predict the health insurance cost incurred by individuals based on their age, gender, body mass index(BMI), number of children, smoking habits, geo location.

The available features are:

* sex: Insurance contracter gender
* bmi: Body mass index (ideally 18.5 to 24.9)
* children: Number of children covered by health insurance
* smoker:  Smoking
* region: The beneficiary's resedential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. 

Target(output):
* charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
